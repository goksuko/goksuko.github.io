Hi there!

I am a software engineering student at Codam Coding College, a 42 Network School in Amsterdam.

I started my coding journey with C by recoding around 30 must-used functions of the C standard library and some other utility functions ([Libft](https://github.com/goksuko/Libft) , [ft_printf](https://github.com/goksuko/ft_printf), and [get_next_line](https://github.com/goksuko/get_next_line)). After doing that job, it was time to make something fancy, so I made a 2D game for Little Red Riding Hood walking through the trees to the house. When it encounters the stalking wolves or reaches the house, the game stops ([so_long](https://github.com/goksuko/so_long)). I also made a project for sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. After manipulating various sorting algorithms, I chose the most appropriate solution for optimized data sorting and obtained a high score ([push_swap](https://github.com/goksuko/push_swap)). In order to practice concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them, I solved dining philosophers' problem with multithreading, multiprocessing, mutexes, and semaphores ([philo](https://github.com/goksuko/philo)). After making an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects with redirections, execution, file handling, pipes, and forking ([pipex](https://github.com/goksuko/pipex)), I started my first group project where we created a simple shell ([minishell](https://github.com/goksuko/minishell)), yes, a shell program in C. This project involves signaling, built-ins, tokenization, and prompt handling. I did the parsing and execution, including file handling, piping, forking, and heredoc.

In addition to my capabilities in C, I wrote a couple of small projects in Python like Hangman, BlackJack, Quiz Brain Game, and Guess the Number where I utilized stacks, linked lists, doubly linked lists, and dictionaries ([python_projects](https://github.com/goksuko/python_projects)). I know the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members, and the usage of the switch in C++ and will learn more in the following weeks.
